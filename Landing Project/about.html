                Greetings JUETians!!!<br><br>

                Welcome back to your alma mater. We missed you. It’s true that “you can take a JUEtian out of JUET, but you can never take JUET out of a JUEtian.” The flame, once lit, never fades away. It’s time to reengage, to reconnect, and rekindle.<br><br>
                
                Dear alumni, this is your page. We wish, through these golden leaves, you will interact among yourselves throughout the globe, wherever you are. Our alumni continue to bring laurels to our institute. The university on its part is keen to fortify the bonds with its alumni. We are very happy to see the alumni are doing very well in life. The recent meetings and get-together all around the globe are re-kindling the sense of companionship among the alumni.<br><br>
                
                Through this portal, we have developed to open up channels of communication with our alumni so that they can be well connected with the students and Institute. We wish to hear your success stories and are here to help you keep in touch with fellow alumni and to keep you informed about what’s happening at the university. Finally do everything to keep the name and fame of the JUET, Guna high. In these challenging economic times, the support of alumni like you will be vital.  Whether as an ambassador, volunteer or donor, you can play an important role in helping the University to achieve its potential and helping students of tomorrow to reach their goals.<br><br>
                
                Wishing you best for this step to bring alumni closer to their past.<br><br>
                
                 Connect, Grow and Succeed<br><br>
